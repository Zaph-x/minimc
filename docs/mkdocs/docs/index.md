# Introduction  

MiniMC is a software verification infrastructure targeting analysis
of binaries rather than high-level source code. A main priority of
MiniMC is to support the development of and experimentation with verification
algorihms on binary code. 

## Analyses   

{{minimc}} currently support two different analysis techniques.

* Explicit StateM odel Checking
* Statistical Model Checking

Both of them are configured to search for program states violating an
assert statement in the program.  

## Supported Input Formats
* LLVM
