# Explicit Value CPA  

The explicit value CPA tracks values for each register. 
It also models explicitly the memory of a program.  

!!! note
	To keep the Explicit Value as simple as possible, it has been decided
	to not support function calls. 
	Instead function calls has to be _inlined_ in a preprocessing step 

## Example  
!!! todo   
	Insert an example showing a pgraph subcommand run on a small example
